# DevopsTutorialProject
For Devops Class Tutorial Project.

This is a dummy repo for the tutorial we have to create, teaching how to set up WSL, install and configure git, link to github and setup and configure nodejs and NPM.

The idea is teaching the new guy on how to set up a development machine on windows for development team that mainly works in linux.
